In addition, they will insist on us buying the equipment for the recruit with a mark-up. 

On the upside, we can expect the recruits to be completely loyal to our cause. However, if necessary, a reliable indoctrination program can be implemented to supplement any deficiencies in that aspect.",,,,,,,,
