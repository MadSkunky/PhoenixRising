## Subparts

### Better Classes

Reworks, rebalances and overhauls all 7 vanilla classes and most of their skills and also introduces entirely different 3rd row of skills that depend on soldier origin, background and class. Below is the explanation how 3rd row is compiled:

Better Classes 3rd row features 2 Background perks, 2 Faction Perks, 2 Class Perks and 1 Proficiency Perk

"Background perks": represent character personality and tell something about himself and postapocalyptic world of Phoenix Point
They are aquired on level 1 and 5 and are chosen randomly from a pool of 19 total perks.

"Faction Perks": Each recruit comes from specific faction that affects his training and abilities. These Perks are aquired on level 2 and 7 and are fixed based on faction, but elite classes(Priest, Technician and Inflitrator) get their own unique faction perks on level 6.

"Class Skills" aquired on lvl 3 and 6 are powerful abilities that define the class and are direct expansion of his row 1 skill tree. As class-defining abilities they are only available on core class, allowing unique multi-class combinations, where Assault-Sniper is not the same as Sniper-Assault.

Finally "Proficiency Perk" is randomly aquired on lvl 4 and simply allows you to learn additional weapon proficiency.
