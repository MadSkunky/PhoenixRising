# Phoenix Rising Mod 

Phoenix Rising is an ambitious project, founded by members of Community Coucil - dedicated group of expert players and beta-testers.

## Subparts

### Better Classes

<b>EARLY ACCESS WARNING</b>
This is a beta-version of the mod with a lot of features incomplete. Currently complete Classes: Assault, Heavy, Sniper, Berserker. It is recommended you DO NOT hire Elite Classes (Priest, Infiltrator, Technician). Please do not change or adjust config settings.

<b>Feedback Request:</b>
1) How do core classes + berserker play at the moment compared to vanilla? 
2) Multi classing options and combinations you find interesting(maybe use a lower diff for that)
3) Your impressions about 3rd row skills and how it affects your gameplay and mood (things you like : backgrounds flavors, faction skills etc?)

<b>Balance Concerns.</b> Some of the following combinations require testing and feedback:
Gunslinger 	Used with Hera or Sneak Attack + Adrenaline + Nergal
Kill Zone	Extreme Focus + Deceptor + OW focus + Jump Jet can lead to very high damage potential
Dash + Kill'n'Run	Possible to achieve very high Mobility
QCE + Hunker Down + True Grit	Possible to achieve very high Damage Reduction
Skirmisher + Bloodlust	Possible to achieve very high Damage 
Berserker Multiclass	Combinations with Assault and Heavy seem particularly powerful

<b>INSTALLATION:</b> 7z file must be selected via "Add Mod" button in Modnix

Do NOT use any language besides ENGLISH, otherwise text will be broken. Sadly, adjusting localisation is a lot of work due to how the game is coded.

COMPATIBILITY: Naturally, this mod is not compatible with any other mod that adjusts skills, perks or Personal abilities.

<b>FEATURES:</b>

BETTER CLASSES: Overhaul and rebalance of all 7 vanilla classes adding many new skills, combos and tactics
Introduces entirely different 3rd row of skills that depend on soldier origin, background and class. Learn more: https://youtu.be/XcaObJJaHCw
BALANCE ADJUSTMENTS: Many skills and some items have been changed in the mod. See complete list of changes here: TBD 
ENEMIES IMPROVED: Worms are made faster and Mindfraggers are more threatening. 
HAVEN RECRUITS COME WITH WEAPONS AND ARMOR: Overrides Vanilla settings for Hero&Legend difficulty.
