# Phoenix Rising Mod 

Phoenix Rising is an ambitious project, founded by members of Community Coucil - dedicated group of expert players and beta-testers. Eventually Phoenix Rising is aiming at significant improvement of core game. We are releasing these improvements as separate mods that one day we hope will come together into a bigger overhaul.
